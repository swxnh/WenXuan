My university life is interesting and different with before. we do not have to attend class everyday and i live with many classmates in dorm, far away with parents. At first, I got very nervous whenever I have to give my opinion and make a presentation in class, because I had not had such experiences before. However, I think that it is the valuable experiences to get accustomed to express my own opinions and feelings.

Teachers come and go for various lectures and u can choose to attend some. 

it seems all are easy and free.

A pleasant part of university life is long vacations. It is very good to consider a plan. I am considering about staying in Australia in next summer vacation. I think it will be an enjoyable vacation and an opportunity for me to get an incentive for the language study
